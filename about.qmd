Hi! I'm Shubham Gupta. I'm a software engineer. I'm from Bengaluru, India, and currently based in Singapore. 

Through this blog, I aim to talk a little bit about my current work and potential topics I'm interested in learning. I'm an active contributor to the [Elixir Ecosystem](https://hex.pm/users/goodhamgupta) and build software, some of which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/goodhamgupta)

I'm always looking to connect with like-minded individuals, discuss ideas and build products. If you'd like to get in touch, Shoot me an email at shubhamg2208 at live dot com.
