Hi! I'm Shubham, an applied AI engineer in Singapore!

Through this blog, I aim to document my learning notes and experience in software development, artificial intelligence and distributed systems.

## Talks

- [Probabilistic Programming in Elixir with Exstan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF0hmQPH4Fs&t=2s&ab_channel=CodeSync)
  - Presented at ElixirConfEU 2024.

## Open-Source

I love [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), and have been packages for probablisitic programming, fast XIRR computation using Newton's method, etc.  The total downloads are [over 250K](https://hex.pm/users/goodhamgupta).

I also actively review AI papers in my spare time, which you can find on my [Github](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/paper_reviews).

## Presentations

- [State Space Models](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/ssm_101)
  - Presented at [Machine Learning, Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/), a top ML community in Singapore.
  - SSM's are a promising alternative to the Attention mechanism used in Transformers.

- [AI-Driven Patient Engagement in Healthcare](BiT.LY/ON‑DEViCE‑LLM‑HEALTHCARE)
  - Engineered mobile app with optimized on‑device LLM ( 3B params) and confidence‑based cloud fallback, using token logits, to large model
running on the cloud
  - Successfully piloted with 100 users, enabling accessible medical guidance in low‑resource regions

- [Structured Generation in LLMs](https://www.figma.com/slides/jW6xIQD8jcE0umtd664Mus/structured_generation?node-id=1-40&t=qkHqP0m6waCzHbJy-0)
  - Presented common methods used to generate structured output from LLMs.

- [End‑to‑End Attention based Image Captioning](bit.ly/attention)
  - Implemented as part of a course project at NUS, and finished in top 10% of the leaderboard in the Kaggle contest.

- [Hierachical Bayesian CLV Model](bit.ly/hierachical-clv)
  - Developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical model for CLV prediction that integrates customer demographics,
achieving 37% improvement in valuation accuracy and enabling data‑driven marketing strategies.


## Technical Challenges

I love working through a varitely of platform providing technical challenges, such as:

- [HackAttic](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/hackattic)
  - Collection of real-world challenges. Ranked in top 10% of participants.
- [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)
  - Collection of challenges to build real-world software.
  - I've completed the challenges of building [Redis](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/codecrafters-redis-python) and a [HTTP Server](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/codecrafters-http-server-python)
