Hi! I'm Shubham, an Applied AI engineer in Singapore.

Through this blog, I aim to document my learning notes and experiences in software development, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.

## Talks

- [Probabilistic Programming in Elixir with Exstan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF0hmQPH4Fs&t=2s&ab_channel=CodeSync)
  - Presented at ElixirConfEU 2024.

## Open-Source

I love [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), and have been creating packages for probabilistic programming, fast XIRR computation using Newton's method, etc. The total downloads are [over 250K](https://hex.pm/users/goodhamgupta).

I actively review AI papers in my spare time, which you can find on my [Github](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/paper_reviews).

## Presentations

- [State Space Models](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/ssm_101)
  - Presented at [Machine Learning, Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/), a top ML community in Singapore.
  - SSMs are a promising alternative to the Attention mechanism used in Transformers.

- [AI-Driven Patient Engagement in Healthcare](https://www.figma.com/deck/N9YJ9O26M71njsRmLVA1Dt/da_presentation?node-id=6-455&t=EV4ATUYjdwF4vIBH-1)
  - Engineered mobile app with optimized on-device LLM (3B params) and confidence-based cloud fallback using token logits to route requests to larger cloud model
  - Successfully piloted with 100 users, enabling accessible medical guidance in low-resource regions
- [Introduction to GPUs and CUDA](https://www.figma.com/deck/Sq9frEEoTFgFWthOJ4EM5w/intro_gpu_cuda?node-id=130-806&t=VNzh9p2qKrHNSTJj-1)
  - Demonstrates basics of GPU architecture and CUDA programming.

- [Structured Generation in LLMs](https://www.figma.com/deck/jW6xIQD8jcE0umtd664Mus/structured_generation?node-id=1-40&t=Q4HPYwD56itXUFAS-1)
  - Presented on common methods used to generate structured output from LLMs.

- [End‑to‑End Attention based Image Captioning](bit.ly/attention)
  - Implemented as part of a course project at NUS, finishing in the top 10% of the leaderboard in the Kaggle contest.

- [Hierachical Bayesian CLV Model](bit.ly/hierachical-clv)
  - Developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical model for CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) prediction that integrates customer demographics, achieving 37% improvement in valuation accuracy and enabling data-driven marketing strategies.


## Technical Challenges

I enjoy solving technical challenges on various platforms:

- [HackAttic](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/hackattic)
  - Collection of real-world challenges. Ranked in top 10% of participants.
- [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)
  - Collection of challenges to build real-world software.
  - I've completed challenges like building [Redis](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/codecrafters-redis-python) and a [HTTP Server](https://github.com/goodhamgupta/codecrafters-http-server-python)
