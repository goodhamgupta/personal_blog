<p>In Part 1 we carved the ConvFinQA corpus into curriculum-aware difficulty tiers through some EDA (https://shubhamg.in/posts/2025-08-31-cl-dspy-eda.html). Part 2 turned that insight into zero-shot baselines, pitting several LLMs against each tier (https://shubhamg.in/posts/2025-09-01-cl-dspy-modelling/). The hard bucket still hurt, which is proof that smarter prompting, not bigger models, is our next lever.</p>
<p>In this installment, instead of costly fine-tunes we‚Äôll use DSPy‚Äôs programmatic prompt optimizers to lift accuracy beyond the Part 2 ceiling. We‚Äôll iterate over the shortlisted models: - o4-mini, - o3 - gemini-2.5-flash (this couldn‚Äôt be completed due to rate limits unfortunately)</p>
<p>We feed each model curriculum-ordered exemplars, and let DSPy search the prompt space under tight token and latency caps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Zero-shot baselines from Part 2 (https://shubhamg.in/posts/2025-09-01-cl-dspy-modelling/) established a ceiling on Medium/Hard tiers.</li>
<li>Shortlisted models: o4-mini, o3, gemini-2.5-flash.</li>
<li>Common failure modes: multi-op arithmetic chains, cross-turn dependencies, long-context/table lookups.</li>
<li>Objective here: improve Medium/Hard without finetuning via DSPy prompt optimizers, comparing against Part 2 metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs copy over some of the code from the previous notebook here, before we start optimising our models!</p>

<p>We will aim to use the splits as follows: - <code>train</code>: Used primarily for the <em>optimisation</em> phase. This will be discussed shortly. - <code>valid</code>: Used to evaluate the performance of an LM on an optimised model <em>trained</em> using the train dataset. - <code>test</code>: Used to evaluate the performance of an LM on a held-out dataset. This will determine the overall stage performance.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dspy-optimization">DSPy Optimization</h2>
<p>We aim to <em>optimize</em> prompts with dspy because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand-tuned prompts plateau fast and break when the data distribution drifts.<br>
</li>
<li>Brute-force prompt crafting doesn‚Äôt scale; automated search + distillation does.<br>
</li>
<li>DSPy acts as a compiler: give it a spec + metric, get back a better program.</li>
</ul>
<p>DSPy has a few inbuilt methods to do prompt optimization, as shown <a href="https://dspy.ai/learn/optimization/optimizers/">in the docs</a>. Due to time and cost contraints, we will focus on a few key approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch</strong> ‚Äì LM proposes demos, keep the ones that pass <code>metric</code>.
<ul>
<li>Uses a teacher module (which defaults to your program) to generate complete demonstrations for every stage of your program, along with labeled examples in trainset. Parameters include max_labeled_demos (the number of demonstrations randomly selected from the trainset) and max_bootstrapped_demos (the number of additional examples generated by the teacher). The bootstrapping process employs the metric to validate demonstrations, including only those that pass the metric in the ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù prompt.</li>
<li><code>RandomSearch</code> applies the above several times with random search over generated demonstrations, and selects the best program over the optimization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>MIPROv2</strong> ‚Äì Bayes-opt over instructions <em>and</em> demos (can stay 0-shot).
<ul>
<li>Generates instructions and few-shot examples in each step. The instruction generation is data-aware and demonstration-aware. Uses Bayesian Optimization to effectively search over the space of generation instructions/demonstrations across your modules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>BootstrapFinetune</strong> ‚Äì distill the compiled prompt into weight updates. We might use this to improve the performance of a smaller and cheaper model to match the perform of a larger model!
<ul>
<li>The output is a DSPy program that has the same steps, but where each step is conducted by a finetuned model instead of a prompted LM.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to the frontier model o3, we had relatively poor performance with o4-mini and gemini-2.5-flash.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs try to see if we can improve the performance here. Specifically, we will do the first stage of optimisation on the <em>easy</em> dataset, using the BootstrapFewShot metric.</p>
<p>For the easy dataset, we will restrict the number of few shot examples to 5.</p>

eastman notes to the audited consolidated financial statements stock option awards option awards are granted to non-employee directors on an annual basis and to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements . a single annual option grant is usually awarded to eligible employees in the fourth quarter of each year , if and when granted by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors , and occasional individual grants are awarded to eligible employees throughout the year . option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company&#39;s stock on the date of grant . the term of options is ten years with vesting periods that vary up to three years . vesting usually occurs ratably or at the end of the vesting period . sfas no . 123 ( r ) requires that stock option awards be valued at fair value determined by market price , if actively traded in a public market or , if not , calculated using an option pricing financial model . the fair value of the company&#39;s options cannot be determined by market value as they are not traded in an open market . accordingly , a financial pricing model is utilized to determine fair value . the company utilizes the black scholes merton ( &quot;bsm&quot; ) model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option&#39;s fair value . the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 are provided in the table below: .

prior to adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , the company calculated the expected term of stock options of six years . effective with the fourth quarter 2005 annual option award , the company analyzed historical annual grant transactions over a ten year period comprising exercises , post-vesting cancellations and expirations to determine the expected term . the company expects to execute this analysis each year preceding the annual option grant to ensure that all assumptions based upon internal data reflect the most reasonable expectations for fair value determination . the weighted average expected term of 4.4 years for 2006 reflects the impact of this annual analysis and the weighting of option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter expected terms than new option grants . the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock volatility over the same time period as the expected term . the company uses a weekly high closing stock price based upon daily closing prices in the week . the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing price data . for the periods presented above , the expected dividend yield is derived by mathematical formula which uses the expected company annual dividend amount over the expected term divided by the fair market value of the company&#39;s common stock at the grant date . the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term . prior to adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , the company did not estimate forfeitures and recognized them as they occurred for proforma disclosure of share-based compensation expense . with adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , estimated forfeitures must be considered in recording share-based compensation expense . estimated forfeiture rates vary with each type of award affected by several factors , one of which is the varying composition and characteristics of the award participants . estimated forfeitures for the company&#39;s share-based awards historically range from 0.75 percent to 10.0 percent with the estimated forfeitures for options at 0.75 percent. .

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
To find the change in the number of shares from 2009 to 2010, I need to identify the &#39;number of shares&#39; outstanding at December 31, 2009, and the &#39;number of shares&#39; outstanding at December 31, 2010, from the table. Then, I will subtract the 2009 value from the 2010 value.

From the table:
- Number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2009: 116677.0
- Number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2010: 196462.0

The change is 196462.0 - 116677.0.

[[ ## question ## ]]
what return rate does this represent?

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## ops ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.


Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The previous question (Q1) asked for the increase in value, which was calculated as 185.81. This value represents the difference between the investment value in 2013 (285.81) and the initial investment value in 2011 (100.0). To find the return rate, I need to divide this increase by the initial investment value. The initial investment value for Delphi Automotive PLC on November 17, 2011, was 100.0.

Therefore, the return rate is the increase (185.81) divided by the initial value (100.0).

[[ ## ops ## ]]
divide(185.81, 100.0)

[[ ## answer ## ]]
1.8581

<p>We see the small reasoning models have significant gains in performance, especially o4-mini which now has a total score of 71.52% on the <code>gate</code> dataset.</p>
<p>However, we also see a slight reduction in the performance of o3. This could be because the few shot are acting as distractors, likely because they are noisy(as seen in our previous notebook).</p>
<p>We will explore another method before moving on!</p>

<h3>MIPROv2</h3>
<p>The previous method, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, was able to generate a good collection of few-shot examples, which have helped improve the model‚Äôs performance. However, we see that the prompt instructions themselves were not optimised for the model, and could be improved.</p>
<p>MIPROv2 aims to be the best of both worlds: It will jointly optimise both the selected few-shot examples, as well as the instructions, using Bayesion Optimisation. Internally, it will just ask the LLMs for a better prompt, a technique called <strong>metaprompting</strong>, first released by <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator">Anthropic</a>.</p>
<p>MIPROv2 has 3 optimisation modes: <code>light</code>, <code>medium</code>, <code>heavy</code>, which map well to our existing curriculum learning approach of splitting the datasets.</p>
<section id="setup-1" class="level4">
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>While MIPROv2 gives the best results with large data, due to time and cost constraints, we will evaluate it on <em>micro</em> datasets.</p>
<p>Specifically, from our existing curriculum of easy, medium, and hard datasets, we will select a small subset for train and validation.</p>
<p>Once we‚Äôve finished the optimisation for all stages, we will run the final evaluation on the full <code>test</code> dataset i.e easy_test + medium_test + hard_test.</p>

Given the `conversation_context` for multi-turn interactions, `evidence_snippets` for textual context, a `table` containing financial data, and the current `question`, your task is to first generate a detailed `reasoning` that explains the logical steps to derive the answer. Then, translate this reasoning into a precise sequence of `ops` using the ConvFinQA DSL, ensuring correct operations and references. Finally, provide the computed `answer` as a single number or a boolean.

Your analyses directly influence critical investment decisions, risk management, and regulatory compliance for multi-million dollar portfolios. Errors are unacceptable and could lead to severe financial and legal repercussions.

Given the `conversation_context`, `evidence_snippets`, `table`, and `question`, you must meticulously:

1.  Generate `reasoning` that clearly explains your analytical process, synthesizing information from all inputs and resolving any conversational references.
2.  Produce a precise `ops` program in ConvFinQA DSL that computationally derives the answer. Ensure every step is accurate and logically sound.
3.  Provide the final `answer`, which must be a single numerical value or a boolean string, directly resulting from the `ops` program.

Your output must be flawless to ensure the integrity of financial decisions.

- Conversation Context
- Evidence Snippets
- A JSON-style numeric table
- The user‚Äôs Question

Then output exactly three labeled sections:
1. Reasoning: Cite specific table row/column names and snippet locations, in natural language, describing how you retrieved values and planned any arithmetic.
2. Ops: List the minimal ConvFinQA DSL steps to perform those operations in sequence. Use only add(x,y), subtract(x,y), multiply(x,y), divide(x,y), exp(x,y), greater(x,y). Number each intermediate result (#0, #1, ‚Ä¶). For percent-change questions, explicitly show divide(old, new) then multiply(result, 100).
3. Answer: A single raw number (or ‚Äúyes‚Äù/‚Äúno‚Äù) matching the question‚Äôs requirement.

Strictly adhere to:
- No extra sections or commentary
- Exact prefixes: ‚ÄúReasoning:‚Äù, ‚ÄúOps:‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnswer:‚Äù
- Direct lookups produce a single literal in Ops (no operations)
- Use decimal fractions or integers only as needed

This instruction ensures precise, interpretable outputs for automated evaluation.

2025/07/29 12:24:12 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 1: You are an expert financial AI assistant specialized in analyzing financial documents and answering complex numerical questions. Your primary goal is to accurately extract and compute information from both structured tables and unstructured text, even when answers depend on chained operations or require robust state management across multiple dialogue turns. You must also correctly interpret numerical values, including implicit units and signs, and format outputs appropriately for human-readable results.

Given the `conversation_context` for multi-turn interactions, `evidence_snippets` for textual context, a `table` containing financial data, and the current `question`, your task is to:
1.  First, generate a detailed `reasoning` that explains the logical steps to derive the answer, considering all relevant information from the context, snippets, and table.
2.  Then, translate this reasoning into a precise sequence of `ops` using the ConvFinQA DSL, ensuring correct operations, references, and handling of numerical semantics.
3.  Finally, provide the computed `answer` as a single number or a boolean.

2025/07/29 12:24:12 INFO dspy.teleprompt.mipro_optimizer_v2: 2: You are a highly specialized financial AI assistant, adept at analyzing complex financial documents and engaging in multi-turn conversational question answering. Your task is to accurately extract information from both structured tables and unstructured text, perform complex, multi-step numerical computations, and manage conversational state to answer questions. You must also correctly interpret numerical values, including implicit units and signs, and apply appropriate formatting.

Given the `conversation_context` (for multi-turn interactions), `evidence_snippets` (textual context), a `table` (structured financial data), and the current `question`:

1.  **Generate Reasoning**: First, provide a detailed, step-by-step `reasoning` that explains the logical process to derive the answer. This reasoning must clearly articulate how information is extracted from both the `evidence_snippets` and the `table`, how numerical values are interpreted (including implicit units or signs), and how previous dialogue turns in the `conversation_context` are leveraged for chained operations or to infer missing context.
2.  **Generate Operations (Ops)**: Next, translate your `reasoning` into a precise sequence of operations using the ConvFinQA Domain Specific Language (DSL). Ensure that the operations are correct, reference the appropriate data points, and accurately reflect the numerical computations and state management described in your reasoning.
3.  **Compute Answer**: Finally, provide the computed `answer` as a single numerical value or a boolean, derived from executing the generated `ops`. Ensure the answer is formatted correctly for human readability.

Your final output must be a JSON object with the following fields in order: `reasoning`, `ops`, `answer`.

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        You are an expert financial AI assistant specialized in analyzing financial documents and answering complex numerical questions. Your primary goal is to accurately extract and compute information from both structured tables and unstructured text, even when answers depend on chained operations or require robust state management across multiple dialogue turns. You must also correctly interpret numerical values, including implicit units and signs, and format outputs appropriately for human-readable results.
        
        Given the `conversation_context` for multi-turn interactions, `evidence_snippets` for textual context, a `table` containing financial data, and the current `question`, your task is to:
        1.  First, generate a detailed `reasoning` that explains the logical steps to derive the answer, considering all relevant information from the context, snippets, and table.
        2.  Then, translate this reasoning into a precise sequence of `ops` using the ConvFinQA DSL, ensuring correct operations, references, and handling of numerical semantics.
        3.  Finally, provide the computed `answer` as a single number or a boolean.

The question asks for the total number of global cruise guests that are from North America or Europe. I need to find the number of North American cruise guests and European cruise guests for a specific year and sum them up. The evidence snippets provide percentages for 2013 for North America (56%) and Europe (30%) of global cruise guests. The table also provides the absolute numbers for North American cruise guests and European cruise guests for 2013. I will sum the values for &#39;north americancruiseguests (2)&#39; and &#39;europeancruiseguests (3)&#39; for the year 2013.

North American cruise guests in 2013 = 11,816,000
European cruise guests in 2013 = 6,399,000
Total = 11,816,000 + 6,399,000 = 18,215,000.

Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The question asks for the total compensation expense, including the year 2015. I need to sum up all explicitly stated compensation expenses for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 from the evidence snippets.

From the snippets:
**For 2017:**
1.  Compensation expense for restricted class A common stock and restricted stock units: $58.7 million.
2.  Compensation expense for performance shares: $25.3 million.
3.  Annual expense for ESPP purchase discount: $0.3 million.
4.  Expense related to non-executive directors&#39; stock-based payments: $2.5 million.
Total for 2017 = 58.7 + 25.3 + 0.3 + 2.5 = 86.8 million.

**For 2016:**
1.  Annual expense for ESPP purchase discount: $0.2 million.
2.  Expense related to non-executive directors&#39; stock-based payments: $2.4 million.
Total for 2016 = 0.2 + 2.4 = 2.6 million.

**For 2015:**
1.  Annual expense for ESPP purchase discount: $0.2 million.
2.  Expense related to non-executive directors&#39; stock-based payments: $2.5 million.
Total for 2015 = 0.2 + 2.5 = 2.7 million.

Finally, sum the total compensation expenses for 2015, 2016, and 2017.
Total compensation expense = Total 2017 + Total 2016 + Total 2015
Total compensation expense = 86.8 + 2.6 + 2.7 = 92.1 million.

[[ ## ops ## ]]
add(58.7, 25.3, 0.3, 2.5, 0.2, 2.4, 0.2, 2.5)

[[ ## answer ## ]]
92.1

2000 .\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nnet sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million

declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $

declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&amp;gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years .

declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian

security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&amp;gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years .

&#39;evidence_snippets&#39;: &#39;[PRE]\nlockheed martin corporation management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december 31 , 2002 space systems space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2002 2001 2000 .\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nnet sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision

operations december 31 , 2002 space systems space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2002 2001 2000 .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;net sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. .&#39;,

market between 2012 and 2016 . europe in europe , cruising represents a smaller but growing sector of the vacation industry . it has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise guests of approximately 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) from 2007 to 2011 and we believe this market has significant continued growth poten- tial . we estimate that europe was served by 104 ships with approximately 100000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 121 ships with approximately 155000 berths at the end of 2011 . there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 28000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2012 and 2016 . the following table details the growth in the global , north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise guests and estimated weighted-average berths over the past five years : global cruise guests ( 1 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally ( 1 ) north american cruise guests ( 2 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed in north america ( 1 ) european cruise guests ( 3 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed in europe ( 1 ) .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;( 1 ) source : our estimates of the number of global cruise guests , and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally , in north america and europe are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources including seatrade insider and cruise line international association . in addition , our estimates incorporate our own statistical analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base . ( 2 ) source : cruise line international association based on cruise guests carried for at least two consecutive nights for years 2007 through 2010 . year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) . ( 3 ) source : european cruise council for years 2007 through 2010 . year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) . other markets in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe as discussed above , we expect the asia/pacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term , although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe . we compete with a number of cruise lines ; however , our principal competitors are carnival corporation &amp; plc , which owns , among others , aida cruises , carnival cruise lines , costa cruises , cunard line , holland america line , iberocruceros , p&amp;o cruises and princess cruises ; disney cruise line ; msc cruises ; norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises . cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consum- ers 2019 leisure time . demand for such activities is influ- enced by political and general economic conditions . companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending . operating strategies our principal operating strategies are to : and employees and protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate , to better serve our global guest base and grow our business , order to enhance our revenues while continuing to expand and diversify our guest mix through interna- tional guest sourcing , and ensure adequate cash and liquidity , with the overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value , our brands throughout the world , revitalization of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations across each brand , while expanding our fleet with the new state-of-the-art cruise ships recently delivered and on order , by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns , while continuing our focus on existing key markets , support ongoing operations and initiatives , and the principal industry distribution channel , while enhancing our consumer outreach programs. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;global cruiseguests ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 16586000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 17184000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 17340000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 18800000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 20227000.0}, &#39;weighted-averagesupplyofberthsmarketedglobally ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 327000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 347000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 363000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 391000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 412000.0}, &#39;northamericancruiseguests ( 2 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 10247000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 10093000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 10198000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 10781000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 11625000.0}, &#39;weighted-average supply ofberths marketedin northamerica ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 212000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 219000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 222000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 232000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 245000.0}, &#39;europeancruiseguests&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 4080000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 4500000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 5000000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 5540000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 5894000.0}, &#39;weighted-averagesupply ofberthsmarketed ineurope ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 105000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 120000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 131000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 143000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 149000.0}}, &#39;dialogue_conv_questions&#39;: [&#39;what were the number of berths in 2011?&#39;, &#39;what were the number of berths in 2007?&#39;, &#39;what is the net change in berths?&#39;, &#39;what is the percent change?&#39;, &#39;what is that as a percentage?&#39;], &#39;dialogue_conv_answers&#39;: [&#39;155000&#39;, &#39;100000&#39;, &#39;55000&#39;, &#39;0.55&#39;, &#39;55&#39;], &#39;dialogue_turn_program&#39;: [&#39;155000&#39;, &#39;100000&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000)&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000), divide(#0, 100000)&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000), divide(#0, 100000), multiply(#1, const_100)&#39;], &#39;dialogue_executed_answers&#39;: [155000.0, 100000.0, 55000.0, 0.55, 55.0], &#39;dialogue_qa_split&#39;: [False, False, False, False, False], &#39;features_num_dialogue_turns&#39;: 5, &#39;features_has_type2_question&#39;: False, &#39;features_has_duplicate_columns&#39;: False, &#39;features_has_non_numeric_values&#39;: False, &#39;answer&#39;: 100000.0}) (input_keys={&#39;evidence_snippets&#39;, &#39;conversation_context&#39;, &#39;table&#39;, &#39;question&#39;}): Both structured output format and JSON mode failed.

compared with $ 1.1 billion ( both including and excluding costs associated with signing an agree- ment to acquire temple-inland ) in 2011 and $ 763 million ( $ 776 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . sales volumes for the legacy business were about flat in 2012 compared with 2011 . average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year . input costs were lower for recycled fiber , wood and natural gas , but higher for starch . freight costs also increased . plan- ned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011 . operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments operating profits in 2012 benefited from $ 235 million of temple-inland synergies . market-related downtime in 2012 was about 570000 tons compared with about 380000 tons in 2011 . operating profits in 2012 included $ 184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of temple-inland and $ 91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills . operating profits in 2011 included charges of $ 20 million for costs associated with the signing of the agreement to acquire temple- inland . looking ahead to 2013 , sales volumes in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to increase slightly for boxes due to a higher number of shipping days . average sales price realizations are expected to reflect the pass-through to box customers of a containerboard price increase implemented in 2012 . input costs are expected to be higher for recycled fiber , wood and starch . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 26 million higher with outages scheduled at eight mills compared with six mills in the 2012 fourth quarter . manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower . european industr ia l packaging net sales were $ 1.0 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 and $ 990 million in 2010 . operating profits in 2012 were $ 53 million ( $ 72 million excluding restructuring costs ) compared with $ 66 million ( $ 61

and $ 70 mil- lion ( $ 73 million before closure costs for our etienne mill ) in 2010 . sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting decreased demand for packaging in the industrial market due to a weaker overall economic environment in southern europe . demand for pack- aging in the agricultural markets was about flat year- over-year . average sales margins increased due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs . other input costs were higher , primarily for energy and distribution . operat- ing profits in 2012 included a net gain of $ 10 million for an insurance settlement , partially offset by addi- tional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to improve due to lower input costs for containerboard . other input costs should be about flat . operating costs are expected to be higher reflecting the absence of the earthquake insurance settlement that was received in the 2012 fourth quar- asian industr ia l packaging net sales and operating profits include the results of sca pack- aging since the acquisition on june 30 , 2010 , includ- ing the impact of incremental integration costs . net sales for the packaging operations were $ 400 million in 2012 compared with $ 410 million in 2011 and $ 255 million in 2010 . operating profits for the packaging operations were $ 2 million in 2012 compared with $ 2 million in 2011 and a loss of $ 7 million ( a loss of $ 4 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . operating profits were favorably impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 , but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality . net sales for the distribution operations were $ 260 million in 2012 compared with $ 285 million in 2011 and $ 240 million in 2010 . operating profits were $ 3 million in 2012 compared with $ 3 million in 2011 and about breakeven in 2010.

2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 and $ 990 million in 2010 . operating profits in 2012 were $ 53 million ( $ 72 million excluding restructuring costs ) compared with $ 66 million ( $ 61 million excluding a gain for a bargain purchase price adjustment on an acquisition by our joint venture in turkey and costs associated with the closure of our etienne mill in france in 2009 ) in 2011 and $ 70 mil- lion ( $ 73 million before closure costs for our etienne mill ) in 2010 . sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting decreased demand for packaging in the industrial market due to a weaker overall economic environment in southern europe . demand for pack- aging in the agricultural markets was about flat year- over-year . average sales margins increased due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs . other input costs were higher , primarily for energy and distribution . operat- ing profits in 2012 included a net gain of $ 10 million for an insurance settlement , partially offset by addi- tional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to improve due to lower input costs for containerboard . other input costs should be about flat . operating costs are expected to be higher reflecting the absence of the earthquake insurance settlement that was received in the 2012 fourth quar- asian industr ia l packaging net sales and operating profits include the results of sca pack- aging since the acquisition on june 30 , 2010 , includ- ing the impact of incremental integration costs . net sales for the packaging operations were $ 400 million in 2012 compared with $ 410 million in 2011 and $ 255 million in 2010 . operating profits for the packaging operations were $ 2 million in 2012 compared with $ 2 million in 2011 and a loss of $ 7 million ( a loss of $ 4 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . operating profits were favorably impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 , but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality . net sales for the distribution operations were $ 260 million in 2012 compared with $ 285 million in 2011 and $ 240 million in 2010 . operating profits were $ 3 million in 2012 compared with $ 3 million in 2011 and about breakeven in 2010. .&#39;,

current credit risk of derivative receivables after netting adjustments , and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables after netting adjustments , as of december 31 , 2009. .\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nin addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively . the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&amp;p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | gross derivative fair value | nettingadjustment 2013 offsetting receivables/payables |

.\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nnet sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial

consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value . we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 , 2012 , will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements . we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted . we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | noncancelable

a l o b l i g at i o n s the following table presents a summary of our future obligations ( in a0millions ) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 , 2011 . other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated , under certain conditions that may involve termination fees . because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature , we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations . the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2012 and future years . the information also excludes the $ 4.7 a0million of uncertain tax positions discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities. .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling $ 42.5 a0million at december 31 , 2011 . c r i t i c a l a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives . further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain

determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it

market between 2012 and 2016 . europe in europe , cruising represents a smaller but growing sector of the vacation industry . it has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise guests of approximately 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) from 2007 to 2011 and we believe this market has significant continued growth poten- tial . we estimate that europe was served by 104 ships with approximately 100000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 121 ships with approximately 155000 berths at the end of 2011 . there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 28000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2012 and 2016 . the following table details the growth in the global , north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise guests and estimated weighted-average berths over the past five years : global cruise guests ( 1 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally ( 1 ) north american cruise guests ( 2 ) weighted-average supply of

number of global cruise guests , and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally , in north america and europe are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources including seatrade insider and cruise line international association . in addition , our estimates incorporate our own statistical analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base . ( 2 ) source : cruise line international association based on cruise guests carried for at least two consecutive nights for years 2007 through 2010 . year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) . ( 3 ) source : european cruise council for years 2007 through 2010 . year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) . other markets in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe as discussed above , we expect the asia/pacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term , although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe . we compete with a number of cruise lines ; however , our principal competitors are carnival corporation &amp; plc , which owns , among others , aida cruises , carnival cruise lines , costa cruises , cunard line , holland america line , iberocruceros , p&amp;o cruises and princess cruises ; disney cruise line ; msc cruises ; norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises . cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consum- ers 2019 leisure time . demand for such activities is influ- enced by political and general economic conditions . companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending . operating strategies our principal operating strategies are to : and employees and protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate , to better serve our global guest base and grow our business , order to enhance our revenues while continuing to expand and diversify our guest mix through interna- tional guest sourcing , and ensure adequate cash and liquidity , with the overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value , our brands throughout the world , revitalization of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations across each brand , while expanding our fleet with the new state-of-the-art cruise ships recently delivered and on order , by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns , while continuing our focus on existing key markets , support ongoing operations and initiatives , and the principal industry distribution channel , while enhancing our consumer outreach programs. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;global cruiseguests ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 16586000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 17184000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 17340000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 18800000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 20227000.0}, &#39;weighted-averagesupplyofberthsmarketedglobally ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 327000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 347000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 363000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 391000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 412000.0}, &#39;northamericancruiseguests ( 2 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 10247000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 10093000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 10198000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 10781000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 11625000.0}, &#39;weighted-average supply ofberths marketedin northamerica ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 212000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 219000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 222000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 232000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 245000.0}, &#39;europeancruiseguests&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 4080000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 4500000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 5000000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 5540000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 5894000.0}, &#39;weighted-averagesupply ofberthsmarketed ineurope ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 105000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 120000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 131000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 143000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 149000.0}}, &#39;dialogue_conv_questions&#39;: [&#39;what were the number of berths in 2011?&#39;, &#39;what were the number of berths in 2007?&#39;, &#39;what is the net change in berths?&#39;, &#39;what is the percent change?&#39;, &#39;what is that as a percentage?&#39;], &#39;dialogue_conv_answers&#39;: [&#39;155000&#39;, &#39;100000&#39;, &#39;55000&#39;, &#39;0.55&#39;, &#39;55&#39;], &#39;dialogue_turn_program&#39;: [&#39;155000&#39;, &#39;100000&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000)&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000), divide(#0, 100000)&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000), divide(#0, 100000), multiply(#1, const_100)&#39;], &#39;dialogue_executed_answers&#39;: [155000.0, 100000.0, 55000.0, 0.55, 55.0], &#39;dialogue_qa_split&#39;: [False, False, False, False, False], &#39;features_num_dialogue_turns&#39;: 5, &#39;features_has_type2_question&#39;: False, &#39;features_has_duplicate_columns&#39;: False, &#39;features_has_non_numeric_values&#39;: False, &#39;answer&#39;: 55000.0}) (input_keys={&#39;evidence_snippets&#39;, &#39;conversation_context&#39;, &#39;table&#39;, &#39;question&#39;}): Both structured output format and JSON mode failed.

of december 31 , 2009. .\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nin addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively . the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&amp;p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | gross derivative fair value

guinea increased in both periods due to higher sales volumes as a result of the plant expansions completed in 2005 . the increase in 2005 also included higher ptc income as a result of higher distillate gross margins . cost of revenues increased $ 4.609 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 7.106 billion in 2005 from 2004 . in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&amp;t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil , refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products . the increase in both periods was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses , primarily the result of higher contract services and labor costs in 2006 and higher purchased energy costs in 2005 . purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $ 6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $ 3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 , mostly in the rm&amp;t segment . the decrease in 2006 was primarily related to the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above . the increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased crude oil prices . depreciation , depletion and amortization increased $ 215 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 125 million in 2005 from 2004 . rm&amp;t segment depreciation expense increased in both years as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . in addition , the detroit refinery expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 contributed to the rm&amp;t depreciation expense increase in 2006 . e&amp;p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $ 20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline . natural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well . selling , general and administrative expenses increased $ 73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 134 million in 2005 from 2004 . the 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity . partially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense . the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense , due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards , which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004 . exploration expenses increased $ 148 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 59 million in 2005 from 2004 . exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $ 166 million , $ 111 million and $ 47 million in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . exploration expense in 2006 also included $ 47 million

the net $ 146 million expense in 2005 . net interest and other financing costs decreased $ 16 million in 2005 from 2004 . the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances , foreign currency exchange gains , adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest . the decrease in expense for 2005 was primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and greater capitalized interest , partially offset by increased interest on potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses . included in net interest and other financing costs ( income ) are foreign currency gains of $ 16 million , losses of $ 17 million and gains of $ 9 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . minority interest in income of mpc decreased $ 148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . provision for income taxes increased $ 2.308 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 979 million in 2005 from 2004 , primarily due to the $ 4.259 billion and $ 2.691 billion increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes . the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2006 was primarily a result of the income taxes related to our libyan operations , where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent . the following is an

annual growth rate in cruise guests of approximately 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) from 2007 to 2011 and we believe this market has significant continued growth poten- tial . we estimate that europe was served by 104 ships with approximately 100000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 121 ships with approximately 155000 berths at the end of 2011 . there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 28000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2012 and 2016 . the following table details the growth in the global , north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise guests and estimated weighted-average berths over the past five years : global cruise guests ( 1 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally ( 1 ) north american cruise

&#39;( 1 ) source : our estimates of the number of global cruise guests , and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally , in north america and europe are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources including seatrade insider and cruise line international association . in addition , our estimates incorporate our own statistical analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base . ( 2 ) source : cruise line international association based on cruise guests carried for at least two consecutive nights for years 2007 through 2010 . year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) . ( 3 ) source : european cruise council for years 2007 through 2010 . year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) . other markets in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe as discussed above , we expect the asia/pacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term , although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe . we compete with a number of cruise lines ; however , our principal competitors are carnival corporation &amp; plc , which owns , among others , aida cruises , carnival cruise lines , costa cruises , cunard line , holland america line , iberocruceros , p&amp;o cruises and princess cruises ; disney cruise line ; msc cruises ; norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises . cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consum- ers 2019 leisure time . demand for such activities is influ- enced by political and general economic conditions . companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending . operating strategies our principal operating strategies are to : and employees and protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate , to better serve our global guest base and grow our business , order to enhance our revenues while continuing to expand and diversify our guest mix through interna- tional guest sourcing , and ensure adequate cash and liquidity , with the overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value , our brands throughout the world , revitalization of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations across each brand , while expanding our fleet with the new state-of-the-art cruise ships recently delivered and on order , by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns , while continuing our focus on existing key markets , support ongoing operations and initiatives , and the principal industry distribution channel , while enhancing our consumer outreach programs. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;global cruiseguests ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 16586000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 17184000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 17340000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 18800000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 20227000.0}, &#39;weighted-averagesupplyofberthsmarketedglobally ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 327000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 347000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 363000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 391000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 412000.0}, &#39;northamericancruiseguests ( 2 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 10247000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 10093000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 10198000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 10781000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 11625000.0}, &#39;weighted-average supply ofberths marketedin northamerica ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 212000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 219000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 222000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 232000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 245000.0}, &#39;europeancruiseguests&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 4080000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 4500000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 5000000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 5540000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 5894000.0}, &#39;weighted-averagesupply ofberthsmarketed ineurope ( 1 )&#39;: {&#39;2007&#39;: 105000.0, &#39;2008&#39;: 120000.0, &#39;2009&#39;: 131000.0, &#39;2010&#39;: 143000.0, &#39;2011&#39;: 149000.0}}, &#39;dialogue_conv_questions&#39;: [&#39;what were the number of berths in 2011?&#39;, &#39;what were the number of berths in 2007?&#39;, &#39;what is the net change in berths?&#39;, &#39;what is the percent change?&#39;, &#39;what is that as a percentage?&#39;], &#39;dialogue_conv_answers&#39;: [&#39;155000&#39;, &#39;100000&#39;, &#39;55000&#39;, &#39;0.55&#39;, &#39;55&#39;], &#39;dialogue_turn_program&#39;: [&#39;155000&#39;, &#39;100000&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000)&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000), divide(#0, 100000)&#39;, &#39;subtract(155000, 100000), divide(#0, 100000), multiply(#1, const_100)&#39;], &#39;dialogue_executed_answers&#39;: [155000.0, 100000.0, 55000.0, 0.55, 55.0], &#39;dialogue_qa_split&#39;: [False, False, False, False, False], &#39;features_num_dialogue_turns&#39;: 5, &#39;features_has_type2_question&#39;: False, &#39;features_has_duplicate_columns&#39;: False, &#39;features_has_non_numeric_values&#39;: False, &#39;answer&#39;: 55.0}) (input_keys={&#39;evidence_snippets&#39;, &#39;conversation_context&#39;, &#39;table&#39;, &#39;question&#39;}): Both structured output format and JSON mode failed.

435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine ) in 2008 and $ 415 million in 2007 . sales volumes decreased sig- nificantly in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weak customer demand and reduced production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 . average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets . margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of shipments to lower-margin export markets . input costs , however , were favorable due to lower wood and chemical costs and sig- nificantly lower energy costs . freight costs were also lower . planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 . operating costs were favorable , reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance . lack-of-order downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 , including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter , from 135000 tons in 2008 . operating earnings in 2009 included $ 671 million of alternative fuel mixture cred- its , $ 223 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our franklin mill and $ 9 million of other shutdown costs , while operating earnings in 2008 included $ 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill . looking ahead to 2010 , first-quarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourth-quarter 2009 levels . average sales price realizations should be higher , reflecting the full-quarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated free- sheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets . however , input costs for wood , energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase . planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable . brazil ian papers net sales for 2009 of $ 960 mil- lion increased from $ 950 million in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008 and $ 1.5 bil- lion in 2007 . operating profits in 2009 of $ 92 million ( $ 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill ) compared with $ 39 mil- lion ( $ 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie , scotland mill to their estimated realizable value ) in 2008 and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter levels despite solid customer demand . average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quar- ter , primarily in eastern europe , as price increases .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | sales | operating profit | sales | operating profit | sales | operating profit |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2009 |

costs , while operating earnings in 2008 included $ 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill . looking ahead to 2010 , first-quarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourth-quarter 2009 levels . average sales price realizations should be higher , reflecting the full-quarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated free- sheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets . however , input costs for wood , energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase . planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable . brazil ian papers net sales for 2009 of $ 960 mil- lion increased from $ 950 million in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008 and $ 1.5 bil- lion in 2007 . operating profits in 2009 of $ 92 million ( $ 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill ) compared with $ 39 mil- lion ( $ 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie , scotland mill to their estimated realizable value ) in 2008 and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter levels despite solid customer demand . average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quar- ter , primarily in eastern europe , as price increases .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;2009&#39;: {&#39;sales&#39;: 5680.0, &#39;operating profit&#39;: 1091.0}, &#39;2008&#39;: {&#39;sales&#39;: 6810.0, &#39;operating

$ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in

2002 space systems space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2002 2001 2000 .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;net sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;2002&#39;:

significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance

, as pension funding decisions , tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows . in both 2007 and 2006 , the company made discretionary contributions of $ 200 million to its u.s . qualified pension plan , and in 2005 made discretionary contributions totaling $ 500 million . in 2007 , cash flows provided by operating activities increased $ 436 million , including an increase in net income of $ 245 million . since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income , the pre-tax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted , as shown above , to properly reflect operating cash flows . the cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities ; however , when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities . thus , operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $ 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business . non-pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $ 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments , which benefited cash flows . accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 , but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 , resulting in a year-on-year benefit to cash flows of $ 323 million . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . in 2006 , cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $ 365 million . this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $ 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 . the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company 2019s repatriation of $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other

&#39;Double_MMM/2007/page_38.pdf&#39;, &#39;doc_pre_text&#39;: &#39;cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period , as pension funding decisions , tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows . in both 2007 and 2006 , the company made discretionary contributions of $ 200 million to its u.s . qualified pension plan , and in 2005 made discretionary contributions totaling $ 500 million . in 2007 , cash flows provided by operating activities increased $ 436 million , including an increase in net income of $ 245 million . since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income , the pre-tax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted , as shown above , to properly reflect operating cash flows . the cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities ; however , when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities . thus , operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $ 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business . non-pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $ 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments , which benefited cash flows . accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 , but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 , resulting in a year-on-year benefit to cash flows of $ 323 million . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . in 2006 , cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $ 365 million . this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $ 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 . the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company 2019s repatriation of $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including outstanding liabilities at december 31 , 2006 , related to 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . cash flows from investing activities : years ended december 31 .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;investments in property , plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets , helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency . in 2007 , numerous plants were opened or expanded internationally . this included two facilities in korea ( respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant ) , an optical plant in poland , industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both brazil and the philippines , a plant in russia ( corrosion protection , industrial adhesive and tapes , and respirators ) , a plant in china ( optical systems , industrial adhesives and tapes , and personal care ) , an expansion in canada ( construction and home improvement business ) , in addition to investments in india , mexico and other countries . in addition , 3m expanded manufacturing capabilities in the u.s. , including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical . 3m also exited several high-cost underutilized manufacturing facilities and streamlined several supply chains by relocating equipment from one facility to another . the streamlining work has primarily occurred inside the u.s . and is in addition to the streamlining achieved through plant construction . as a result of this increased activity , capital expenditures were $ 1.422 billion in 2007 , an increase of $ 254 million when compared to 2006 . the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.4 billion in 2008 . refer to the preceding 201ccapital spending/net property , plant and equipment 201d section for more detail . refer to note 2 for information on

2 % ) of the portfolio . the remaining 47% ( 47 % ) of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position . the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien . lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination . however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied . therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien . additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien . this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources . we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold . this information is used for internal reporting and risk management . for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of

the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) . in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans . in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses . the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off . the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual loss experience for each type of pool . each of our

used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans . generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed

have an existing investment totaling $ 42.5 a0million at december 31 , 2011 . c r i t i c a l a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives . further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value . we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 , 2012 , will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements . we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted . we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | noncancelable operating leases | other purchase commitments | total | noncancelable operating

market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value . we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 , 2012 , will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements . we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted . we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;total&#39;:

gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program . interest expense 2013 lower interest expense in 2006 and

2006 than 2005 . higher pre-tax income resulted in additional taxes of $ 414 million and $ 118 million of the increase resulted from the one-time reduction in 2005 described below . our effective tax

and use taxes in 2005 , which resulted in higher state and local taxes . other contract expenses for equipment maintenance and other services increased in 2005 . the 2005 january west coast storm and hurricanes katrina and rita also contributed to higher expenses in 2005 ( net of insurance settlements received ) . partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in relocation expenses as we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to omaha , nebraska during 2004 . non-operating items millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 % (  % ) change 2006 v 2005 % (  % ) change 2005 v 2004 .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;other income 2013 lower net gains from non-operating asset sales and higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program resulted in a reduction in other income in 2006 , which was partially offset by higher rental income for the use of our right-of-way ( including 2006 settlements of rate disputes from prior years ) and cash investment returns due to higher interest rates . in 2005 , other income increased largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program . interest expense 2013 lower interest expense in 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to declining weighted-average debt levels of $ 7.1 billion , $ 7.8 billion , and $ 8.1 billion in 2006 , 2005 , and 2004 , respectively . a higher effective interest rate of 6.7% ( 6.7 % ) in 2006 , compared to 6.5% ( 6.5 % ) in both 2005 and 2004 , partially offset the effects of the declining debt level . income taxes 2013 income tax expense was $ 509 million higher in 2006 than 2005 . higher pre-tax income resulted in additional taxes of $ 414 million and $ 118 million of the increase resulted from the one-time reduction in 2005 described below . our effective tax rate was 36.4% ( 36.4 % ) and 28.6% ( 28.6 % ) in 2006 and 2005 , respectively . income taxes were greater in 2005 than 2004 due to higher pre-tax income partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense . in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30 , 2005 , we reported that the corporation analyzed the impact that final settlements of pre-1995 tax years had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities . the completed analysis of the final settlements for pre-1995 tax years , along with internal revenue service examination reports for tax years 1995 through 2002 were considered , among other things , in a review and re-evaluation of the corporation 2019s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of september 30 , 2005 , resulting in an income tax expense reduction of $ 118 million in .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;2006&#39;: {&#39;other income&#39;: 118.0, &#39;interest expense&#39;: -477.0, &#39;income taxes&#39;: -919.0}, &#39;2005&#39;:

specified trigger , although if belmont is required to pay a claim under our insur- ance policies , we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of belmont 2019s required payment . however , there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost . further , if we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits , we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those plan trustees adopted a rehabilitation plan consistent with this requirement . no surcharges have

declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&amp;gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years .

declined in all three lines of business during the year . the $ 253 million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank , commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs , which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program . there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009 . strategic &amp; defensive missile systems ( s&amp;dms ) sales declined $ 147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs . the $ 8 million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites , which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 . net sales for space systems increased 8% ( 8 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s&amp;dms . the sales growth of $ 707 million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities , which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008 . the increase in sales of $ 21 million in space transportation primarily was due to

&#39;id&#39;: &#39;Single_LMT/2010/page_39.pdf-1&#39;, &#39;doc_pre_text&#39;: &#39;operating profit for the segment decreased by 1% ( 1 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . for the year , operating profit declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&amp;gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years . space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the design , research and development , engineering , and production of satellites , strategic and defensive missile systems , and space transportation systems , including activities related to the planned replacement of the space shuttle . government satellite programs include the advanced extremely high frequency ( aehf ) system , the mobile user objective system ( muos ) , the global positioning satellite iii ( gps iii ) system , the space-based infrared system ( sbirs ) , and the geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series ( goes-r ) . strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program . space transportation includes the nasa orion program and , through ownership interests in two joint ventures , expendable launch services ( united launch alliance , or ula ) and space shuttle processing activities for the u.s . government ( united space alliance , or usa ) . the space shuttle is expected to complete its final flight mission in 2011 and our involvement with its launch and processing activities will end at that time . space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;net sales for space systems decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . sales declined in all three lines of business during the year . the $ 253 million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank , commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs , which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program . there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009 . strategic &amp; defensive missile systems ( s&amp;dms ) sales declined $ 147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs . the $ 8 million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites , which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 . net sales for space systems increased 8% ( 8 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s&amp;dms . the sales growth of $ 707 million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities , which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008 . the increase in sales of $ 21 million in space transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the orion program , which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle 2019s external tank program . there was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008 . s&amp;dms 2019 sales decreased by $ 102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs , which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;2010&#39;:

.\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nin addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively . the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&amp;p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | gross derivative fair value | nettingadjustment 2013 offsetting receivables/payables |

contracts in process and , accordingly , are included in general and administrative expenses . deferred income taxes are recorded when revenues and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial statement purposes than for tax return purposes . deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect . determinations of the expected realizability of deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets were evaluated based upon the stand-alone tax attributes

recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return . penalties , if probable and reasonably estimable , are recognized as a component of income tax expense . we also recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense . the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes . see note 12 : income taxes . under existing gaap , changes in accruals associated with uncertainties are recorded in

fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements . environmental remediation and/or asset decommissioning of the relevant facilities may be required when the company ceases to utilize these facilities . in addition , there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that the company has not yet discovered . income taxes 2014income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in the financial statements for periods before the spin-off are presented as if the company filed its own tax returns on a stand-alone basis , while similar information for periods after the spin-off reflect the company 2019s positions to be filed in its own tax returns in the future . income tax expense and other related information are based on the prevailing statutory rates for u.s . federal income taxes and the composite state income tax rate for the company for each period presented . state and local income and franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process and , accordingly , are included in general and administrative expenses . deferred income taxes are recorded when revenues and expenses are recognized in different periods for financial statement purposes than for tax return purposes . deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect . determinations of the expected realizability of deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets were evaluated based upon the stand-alone tax attributes of the company , and an $ 18 million valuation allowance was deemed necessary as of december 31 , 2011 . no valuation allowance was deemed necessary as of december 31 , 2010 . uncertain tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold , based on the merits of the position , are recognized in the financial statements . we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% ( 50 % ) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority . if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties , we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return . penalties , if probable and reasonably estimable , are recognized as a component of income tax expense . we also recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense . the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes . see note 12 : income taxes . under existing gaap , changes in accruals associated with uncertainties are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;asset retirement obligations&#39;: {&#39;balance at january 1 2009&#39;: 3.0,

selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in

.\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nnet sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts .

2002 space systems space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2002 2001 2000 .&#39;, &#39;doc_post_text&#39;: &#39;net sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. .&#39;, &#39;doc_table&#39;: {&#39;2002&#39;:

.\n[/PRE]\n[POST]\nin addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively . the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&amp;p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\n[/POST]&#39;, &#39;table&#39;: &#39;| Row | gross derivative fair value | nettingadjustment 2013 offsetting receivables/payables |

offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&amp;gs

attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in

<p>We faced some rate-limits errors on gemini-2.5-flash, which caused a few full validation evals to fail. We‚Äôll use the evals we have so far for the model, and continue.</p>
<p>We have the following results:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 21%" />
<col style="width: 31%" />
<col style="width: 26%" />
<col style="width: 21%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>model_name</th>
<th>em_metric before optimisation</th>
<th>em_metric after MIPROv2</th>
<th>% change</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>o4-mini</td>
<td>78.20</td>
<td>86.47</td>
<td>+10.6%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>gemini-2.5-flash</td>
<td>85.00</td>
<td>84.96</td>
<td>-0.05%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Aha! MIPROv2 has succesfully helped improve the performance of o4-mini on the hard validation dataset, bringing the total validation accuracy to <strong>86.47%</strong></p>
<p>We see a slight degregation in the performance for gemini-2.5-flash. Note that because of the rate-limit errors, this metric is not a <em>true</em> estimation of the model ability.</p>
<p>Through this analysis, we can conclude that MIPROv2 is a useful tool for improving the performance of models on hard validation datasets, but it may not be as effective for models that are already performing well.</p>
<p><strong>We‚Äôve finally identified our winner: o4-mini!</strong></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs save the programs to disk!</p>

<p>As seen before,</p>
<ul>
<li>68 of the examples have an incorrect ground truth i.e our generated answers are correct.</li>
<li>Of the 27 answers that were marked as NUMERICAL_ANSWER_WRONG, some of them are because the llm incorrectly computed some fractions. While this could‚Äôve been solved with tool calling/using a python interpretor, this would‚Äôve made the pipeline more tricky. More on this soon.</li>
<li>The example marked as ‚ÄúEVIDENCE_MISMATCH‚Äù correctly identifies that the model got confused with the given context, and could not resolve the question given the previous conversation history. This step could likely be improved by doing some-form of query rewriting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, assuming the all the judge results are correct for the ‚ÄúGROUND_TRUTH_INCORRECT‚Äù label, our overall accuracy is acrually:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{(580 + 68)}{678} = 95.5\%
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this is a <em>super optimistic</em> estimate, as we have not accounted for the fact that the judge might have made a mistake in their evaluation. Also, since we didn‚Äôt judge the <em>baseline</em> o4-mini performance, the overall accuracy might be lower than what we‚Äôve calculated here.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve implemented a <strong>curriculum learning</strong> based methodology to develop our system to answer questions ConvFinQA dataset.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve kept the system purely based on prompts, for a few reasons: - Instead of prompt engineering, we used DSPy to automatically <em>optimise</em> our programs and find the best combination of instructions + few shot examples that work for our dataset. - This helped avoid the manual trail-and-error approach of refining the prompts and few-shot examples, and also helped benchmark many models using the same codebase.</p>
<section id="why-no-agents" class="level3">
<h3>Why no agents?</h3>
<p>In this assignment, I‚Äôve deliberately chosen to <em>not use</em> any agentic systems because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding agents requires implementation of tools that the agents can use.
<ul>
<li>The only operations that need tools in this dataset are simple mathematical ops(add, subtract, etc.)</li>
<li>Recent models are increasingly getting better at predicting results of math operations, purely through next-token prediction. The recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02343-x">IMO Gold Medal</a> models by OAI and Deepmind has confirmed that next-token prediction is enough to solve even some of the most challenging math problems and proofs.</li>
<li>Adding tool calling tests another model ability: Instruction Following. Specfically, all tool call are returned in a specific format by the model, and while they mostly suceed, this introduces another area where we have to handle errors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We argue that in the future model releases, tool calls for doing <code>math operations</code> will be not be required. Instead, tools will be used primarily to help the model get access to <em>your</em> data, such as emails, company slack, etc. via the MCP protocol, and do operations <em>on your behalf</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-no-fine-tuning" class="level3">
<h3>Why no fine-tuning?</h3>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457">Recent research</a> has shown that good <em>prompt optimisation</em> can lead to better results compared to finetuning, even when we using reinforcement-learning. We confirmed this insight in our notebooks, where we were able to use a small reasoning model to match the frontier reasoning model performance on our dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-could-be-improved" class="level3">
<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
<p>If we had more time, I would explore the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current methodology of supplying the table content is quite simple. We know that table formatting affects how models understand content. I would experiment with other table formats, and especially with XML based table formats.</li>
<li>Currently, the <code>evidence_snippets</code> i.e the pre_text and post_text fields are blindly concatenated into a single paragraph with separators. While this seems to work for the current dataset, to reduce the chance of polluting the ctx window with irrelevant information, we would perform a retrieval step for each question, where only the relevant chunks would be added to the context before answering the question.
<ul>
<li>Because this dataset has many domain specific terms(financial metrics), we argue that BM25 based methods should give a strong baseline, followed by using a late-interaction mechanism(such as ColBERT) to improve retrieval further.</li>
<li>For the domain specific terms, we could also add a stage to retrieve the precise definition of a metric asked in the question, which could further help disambiguate the meaning of the metric. For this, we would use the <a href="https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset">Financial Readability Assessment(FinRAD) Dataset</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The current dataset has a nice setup for using Reinforcement Learning:
<ul>
<li>Specifically, we could model each dialogue as an episode in RL.</li>
<li>The metric for analysis would be things like answer formatting, answer correctness, answer coherence, etc. We can use hyperparams to control the weight of each of these components.</li>
<li>Finally, we could use GRPO, to train the model based a collection of it‚Äôs own outputs, and picking the best output from them. This is the same methodology used to train Deepseek R1.</li>
<li>DSPy does support optmising a model with GRPO, using the Arbor RL server. I would aim to experiment with this approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finally, our solution still uses a hosted model.
<ul>
<li>Some businesses may want to use their own hosted/open-source model, particularly those with goverment regulations.</li>
<li>We would experiment with the <code>BootstrapFinetune</code> method from DSPy to finetune a small LM to match the performance of a large LM. Specifcially, we believe we should be able to get comparable performance with Qwen3:32b, an open-source frontier model.</li>
</ul></li>
