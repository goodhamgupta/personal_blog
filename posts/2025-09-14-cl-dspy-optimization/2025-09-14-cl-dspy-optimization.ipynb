    "In Part 1 we carved the ConvFinQA corpus into curriculum-aware difficulty tiers through some EDA (https://shubhamg.in/posts/2025-08-31-cl-dspy-eda.html). Part 2 turned that insight into zero-shot baselines, pitting several LLMs against each tier (https://shubhamg.in/posts/2025-09-01-cl-dspy-modelling/). The hard bucket still hurt, which is proof that smarter prompting, not bigger models, is our next lever.\n",

Parameters include max_labeled_demos (the number of demonstrations randomly selected from the trainset) and max_bootstrapped_demos (the number of additional examples generated by the teacher). The bootstrapping process employs the metric to validate demonstrations, including only those that pass the metric in the \"compiled\" prompt. \n",

    "- **MIPROv2** ‚Äì Bayes-opt over instructions *and* demos (can stay 0-shot).\n",
    "  - Generates instructions and few-shot examples in each step. The instruction generation is data-aware and demonstration-aware. Uses Bayesian Optimization to effectively search over the space of generation instructions/demonstrations across your modules.\n",
    "- **BootstrapFinetune** ‚Äì distill the compiled prompt into weight updates. We might use this to improve the performance of a smaller and cheaper model to match the perform of a larger model!\n",

      "prior to adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , the company calculated the expected term of stock options of six years . effective with the fourth quarter 2005 annual option award , the company analyzed historical annual grant transactions over a ten year period comprising exercises , post-vesting cancellations and expirations to determine the expected term . the company expects to execute this analysis each year preceding the annual option grant to ensure that all assumptions based upon internal data reflect the most reasonable expectations for fair value determination . the weighted average expected term of 4.4 years for 2006 reflects the impact of this annual analysis and the weighting of option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter expected terms than new option grants . the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock volatility over the same time period as the expected term . the company uses a weekly high closing stock price based upon daily closing prices in the week . the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing price data . for the periods presented above , the expected dividend yield is derived by mathematical formula which uses the expected company annual dividend amount over the expected term divided by the fair market value of the company's common stock at the grant date . the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term . prior to adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , the company did not estimate forfeitures and recognized them as they occurred for proforma disclosure of share-based compensation expense . with adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , estimated forfeitures must be considered in recording share-based compensation expense . estimated forfeiture rates vary with each type of award affected by several factors , one of which is the varying composition and characteristics of the award participants . estimated forfeitures for the company's share-based awards historically range from 0.75 percent to 10.0 percent with the estimated forfeitures for options at 0.75 percent. .\n",

security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission

civil . we expect is&gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years . space

operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in

pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14

satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures

evidence to the contrary , level 3 cash instruments are initially valued at transaction price , which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value . subsequently , the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value , which vary based on the type of instrument . valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence , including values realized on sales . valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument , but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques . the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below : loans and securities backed by commercial real estate . loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties , and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination . significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include : 2030 market yields

securities , investments in funds at nav , and other non-derivative financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold , but not yet purchased . see below for the types of cash instruments included in each level of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine their fair values . see note 5 for an overview of the firm 2019s fair value measurement policies . level 1 cash instruments level 1 cash instruments include certain money market instruments , u.s . government obligations , most non-u.s . government obligations , certain government agency obligations , certain corporate debt instruments and actively traded listed equities . these instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets . the firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument . the firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity . level 2 cash instruments level 2 cash instruments include most money market instruments , most government agency obligations , certain non-u.s . government obligations , most mortgage-backed loans and securities , most corporate debt instruments , most state and municipal obligations , most other debt obligations , restricted or less liquid listed equities , commodities and certain lending commitments . valuations of level 2 cash instruments can be verified to quoted prices , recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments , broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency . consideration is given to the nature of the quotations ( e.g. , indicative or firm ) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources . valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 cash instruments ( i ) if the cash instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or ( ii ) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value . valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence . level 3 cash instruments level 3 cash instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable . absent evidence to the contrary , level 3 cash instruments are initially valued at transaction price , which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value . subsequently , the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value , which vary based on the type of instrument . valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence , including values realized on sales . valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument , but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques . the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below : loans and securities backed by commercial real estate . loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties , and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination . significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include : 2030 market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices such as the cmbx ( an index

for numerous hyco ( hydrogen , carbon monoxide , and syngas ) facilities . the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas . however , long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply . due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts , we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations . refer to note 17 , commitments and contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations . the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations , which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers . in addition , purchase commitments to spend approximately $ 540 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2016 . we also purchase materials , energy

credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor

facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value . we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 , 2012 , will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements . we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted . we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. .\\n[/POST]', 'table': '| Row | noncancelable operating leases | other purchase commitments | total | noncancelable operating leases | other

contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\\n[/POST]', 'table': '| Row | gross derivative fair value |

43 . income from equity method investments increased by $ 126 million in 2006 from 2005 and increased by $ 98 million in 2005 from 2004 . income from our lpg operations in equatorial guinea increased in both periods due to higher sales volumes as a result of the plant expansions completed in 2005 . the increase in 2005 also included higher ptc income as a result of higher distillate gross margins . cost of revenues increased $ 4.609 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 7.106 billion in 2005 from 2004 . in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil , refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products . the increase in both periods was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses , primarily the result of higher contract services and labor costs in 2006 and higher purchased energy costs in 2005 . purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $ 6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $ 3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 , mostly in the rm&t segment . the decrease in 2006 was primarily related to the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above . the increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased crude oil prices . depreciation , depletion and amortization increased $ 215 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 125 million in 2005 from 2004 . rm&t segment depreciation expense increased in both years as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . in addition , the detroit refinery expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 contributed to the rm&t depreciation expense increase in 2006 . e&p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $ 20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline . natural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well . selling , general and administrative expenses increased $ 73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 134 million in 2005 from 2004 . the 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity . partially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense . the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense , due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards , which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004 . exploration expenses increased $ 148 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 59 million in 2005 from 2004 . exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $ 166 million , $ 111 million and $ 47 million in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . exploration expense in 2006 also included $ 47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia . net interest and other financing costs ( income ) reflected a net $ 37 million of income for 2006 , a favorable change of $ 183 million from the net $ 146 million expense in 2005 . net interest and other financing costs decreased $ 16 million in 2005 from 2004 . the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances , foreign currency

7.106 billion in 2005 from 2004 . in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil , refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products . the increase in both periods was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses , primarily the result of higher contract services and labor costs in 2006 and higher purchased energy costs in 2005 . purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $ 6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $ 3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 , mostly in the rm&t segment . the decrease in 2006 was primarily related to the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above . the increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased crude oil prices . depreciation , depletion and amortization increased $ 215 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 125 million in 2005 from 2004 . rm&t segment depreciation expense increased in both years as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . in addition , the detroit refinery expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 contributed to the rm&t depreciation expense increase in 2006 . e&p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $ 20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline . natural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well . selling , general and administrative expenses increased $ 73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 134 million in 2005 from 2004 . the 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity . partially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense . the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense , due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards , which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004 . exploration expenses increased $ 148 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 59 million in 2005 from 2004 . exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $ 166 million , $ 111 million and $ 47 million in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . exploration expense in 2006 also included $ 47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia . net interest and other financing costs ( income ) reflected a

the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances , foreign currency exchange gains , adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest . the decrease in expense for 2005 was primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and greater capitalized interest , partially offset

it owns to col- lateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings . pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the secured party are identified as financial instruments owned ( pledged to various parties ) on the consolidated balance sheets . at december 31 , 2008 , the firm received securities as collateral that could be repledged , delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of approximately $ 511.9 billion . this collateral was generally obtained under resale or securities borrowing agreements . of these securities , approximately $ 456.6 billion were repledged , delivered or otherwise used , generally as collateral under repurchase agreements , securities lending agreements or to cover short sales . note 14 2013 loans the accounting for a loan may differ based upon whether it is origi- nated or purchased and as to whether the loan is used in an invest- ing or trading strategy . for purchased loans held-for-investment , the accounting also differs depending on whether a loan is credit- impaired at the date of acquisition . purchased loans with evidence of credit deterioration since the origination date and for which it is probable , at acquisition , that all contractually required payments receivable will not be collected are considered to be credit-impaired . the measurement framework for loans in the consolidated financial statements is one of the following : 2022 at the principal amount outstanding , net of the allowance for loan losses , unearned income and any net deferred loan fees or costs , for loans held for investment ( other than purchased credit- impaired loans ) ; 2022 at the lower of cost or fair value , with valuation changes record- ed in noninterest revenue , for loans that are classified as held- for-sale ; or 2022 at fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue , for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on a fair value basis ; 2022 purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account- ed for under sop 03-3 and initially measured at fair value , which includes estimated future credit losses . accordingly , an allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the acquisition date . see note 5 on pages 156 2013158 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s elections of fair value accounting under sfas 159 . see note 6 on pages 158 2013160 of this annual report for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets . for loans held for investment , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio . transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer . credit-related losses are charged off to the allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates , or exchange rates , are recognized in noninterest revenue . loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value . these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firm 2019s allowance methodology . for a fur- ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses , see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis- continued . loans ( other than certain consumer and purchased credit- impaired loans

substantive observable evidence , including values realized on sales . valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument , but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques . the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below : loans and securities backed by commercial real estate . loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties , and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination . significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value

compared to north america and europe . we compete with a number of cruise lines ; however , our principal competitors are carnival corporation & plc , which owns , among others , aida cruises , carnival cruise lines , costa cruises , cunard line , holland america line , iberocruceros , p&o cruises and princess cruises ; disney cruise line ; msc cruises ; norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises . cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consum- ers 2019 leisure time . demand for such activities is influ- enced by political and general economic conditions . companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending . operating strategies our principal operating strategies are to : and employees and protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate , to better serve our global guest base and grow our business , order to enhance our revenues while

securities gains and private equity gains in corporate/private equity , higher asset management fees in am and administration fees in tss , and higher other income in several businesses , partially offset by lower credit card income . investment banking fees decreased from 2009 due to lower equity underwriting and advisory fees , partially offset by higher debt underwriting fees . competitive markets combined with flat industry-wide equity underwriting and completed m&a volumes , resulted in lower equity underwriting and advisory fees ; while strong industry-wide loan syndication and

driven by the private equity business , which had significant private equity gains in 2010 , compared with a small loss in 2009 , reflecting improvements in market conditions . trading revenue

production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 . average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets . margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher

lower . planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 . operating costs were favorable , reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance . lack-of-order downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 , including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter , from 135000 tons in 2008 . operating earnings in

higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3

and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to

in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008 and $ 1.5 bil- lion in 2007 . operating profits in 2009 of $ 92 million ( $ 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill ) compared with $ 39 mil- lion ( $ 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie , scotland mill to their estimated realizable value ) in 2008 and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter levels despite solid customer demand . average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quar- ter , primarily in eastern europe , as price increases .', 'doc_table': {'2009': {'sales': 5680.0, 'operating profit': 1091.0}, '2008': {'sales': 6810.0, 'operating profit': 474.0}, '2007': {'sales':

performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. .', 'doc_table': {'2002': {'net sales': 7384.0, 'operating profit': 443.0}, '2001': {'net sales': 6836.0, 'operating

a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives . further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i

acceptable alternatives . further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our

available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale

of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than

information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination . however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied . therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien . additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien . this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources . we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold . this information is used for internal reporting and risk management . for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit

delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) . in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans . in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance

that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised

frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\\n[/POST]', 'table': '| Row | gross derivative fair value | nettingadjustment 2013 offsetting receivables/payables | nettingadjustment 2013 cash

values realized on sales . valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument , but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques . the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below : loans

portfolio of properties , and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination . significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include : 2030 market yields

can be verified to quoted prices , recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments , broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency . consideration is given to the nature of the quotations ( e.g. , indicative or firm ) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources . valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 cash instruments ( i ) if the cash instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or ( ii ) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value . valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence . level 3 cash instruments level 3 cash instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable . absent evidence to the contrary , level 3 cash instruments are initially valued at transaction price , which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value . subsequently , the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value , which vary based on the type of instrument . valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence , including values realized on sales . valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument , but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques . the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below : loans and securities backed by commercial real estate . loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties , and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination . significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include : 2030 market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices such as the cmbx ( an index

those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w

believe this market has significant continued growth poten- tial . we estimate that europe was served by 104 ships with approximately 100000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 121 ships with approximately 155000 berths at the end of 2011 . there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 28000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2012 and 2016 . the following table details the growth in the global , north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise guests and estimated weighted-average berths over the past five years : global cruise guests ( 1 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally ( 1 ) north american cruise guests ( 2 ) weighted-average supply of berths marketed in north america ( 1 ) european

individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor

the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009

2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during

programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos )

experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program .

value of approximately $ 511.9 billion . this collateral was generally obtained under resale or securities borrowing agreements . of these securities , approximately $ 456.6 billion were repledged , delivered or otherwise used , generally as collateral under repurchase agreements , securities lending agreements or to cover short sales . note 14 2013 loans the accounting for a loan may differ based upon whether it is origi- nated or purchased and as to whether the loan is used in an invest- ing or trading strategy . for purchased loans held-for-investment , the accounting also differs depending on whether a loan is credit- impaired at the date of acquisition . purchased loans with evidence of credit deterioration since the origination date and for which it is probable , at acquisition , that all contractually required payments receivable will not be collected are considered to be credit-impaired . the measurement framework for loans in the consolidated financial statements is one of the following : 2022 at the principal amount outstanding , net of the allowance for loan losses , unearned income and any net deferred loan fees or costs , for loans held for investment ( other than purchased credit- impaired loans ) ; 2022 at the lower of cost or fair value , with valuation changes record- ed in noninterest revenue , for loans that are classified as held- for-sale ; or 2022 at fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue , for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on a fair value basis ; 2022 purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account- ed for under sop 03-3 and initially measured at fair value , which includes estimated future credit losses . accordingly , an allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the acquisition date . see note 5 on pages 156 2013158 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s elections of fair value accounting under sfas 159 . see note 6 on pages 158 2013160 of this annual report for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets . for loans held for investment , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio . transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer . credit-related losses are charged off to the allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates , or exchange rates , are recognized in noninterest revenue . loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value . these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firm 2019s allowance methodology . for a fur- ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses , see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis- continued . loans ( other than certain consumer and purchased credit- impaired loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of princi- pal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover principal and interest . loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized . interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income . in addition , the amortiza- tion of net deferred loan fees is suspended . interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash . however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate col- lectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans ( i.e. , the cost recovery method ) . loans are restored to accrual status only when future pay- ments of interest and principal are reasonably assured . consumer loans , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy . for example , credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiv- ing notification of the filing of bankruptcy , whichever is earlier . residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net real- izable value at no later than 180 days past due . other consumer .\\n[/POST]', 'table': '| Row | securities purchased under resale agreements ( a ) | securities borrowed ( b ) | securities sold under repurchase agreements ( c

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We've implemented a **curriculum learning** based methodology to develop our system to answer questions ConvFinQA dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've kept the system purely based on prompts, for a few reasons:\n",
    "- Instead of prompt engineering, we used DSPy to automatically _optimise_ our programs and find the best combination of instructions + few shot examples that work for our dataset.\n",
    "  - This helped avoid the manual trail-and-error approach of refining the prompts and few-shot examples, and also helped benchmark many models using the same codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why no agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I've deliberately chosen to _not use_ any agentic systems because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding agents requires implementation of tools that the agents can use. \n",
    "   - The only operations that need tools in this dataset are simple mathematical ops(add, subtract, etc.)\n",
    "   - Recent models are increasingly getting better at predicting results of math operations, purely through next-token prediction. The recent [IMO Gold Medal](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02343-x) models by OAI and Deepmind has confirmed that next-token prediction is enough to solve even some of the most challenging math problems and proofs.\n",
    "   - Adding tool calling tests another model ability: Instruction Following. Specfically, all tool call are returned in a specific format by the model, and while they mostly suceed, this introduces another area where we have to handle errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We argue that in the future model releases, tool calls for doing `math operations` will be not be required. Instead, tools will be used primarily to help the model get access to _your_ data, such as emails, company slack, etc. via the MCP protocol, and do operations _on your behalf_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why no fine-tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Recent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457) has shown that good _prompt optimisation_ can lead to better results compared to finetuning, even when we using reinforcement-learning. We confirmed this insight in our notebooks, where we were able to use a small reasoning model to match the frontier reasoning model performance on our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What could be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had more time, I would explore the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current methodology of supplying the table content is quite simple. We know that table formatting affects how models understand content. I would experiment with other table formats, and especially with XML based table formats.\n",
    "- Currently, the `evidence_snippets` i.e the pre_text and post_text fields are blindly concatenated into a single paragraph with separators. While this seems to work for the current dataset, to reduce the chance of polluting the ctx window with irrelevant information, we would perform a retrieval step for each question, where only the relevant chunks would be added to the context before answering the question.\n",
    "  - Because this dataset has many domain specific terms(financial metrics), we argue that BM25 based methods should give a strong baseline, followed by using a late-interaction mechanism(such as ColBERT) to improve retrieval further.\n",
    "  - For the domain specific terms, we could also add a stage to retrieve the precise definition of a metric asked in the question, which could further help disambiguate the meaning of the metric. For this, we would use the [Financial Readability Assessment(FinRAD) Dataset](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FinRAD_Financial_Readability_Assessment_Dataset).\n",
    "- The current dataset has a nice setup for using Reinforcement Learning:\n",
    "  - Specifically, we could model each dialogue as an episode in RL.\n",
    "  - The metric for analysis would be things like answer formatting, answer correctness, answer coherence, etc. We can use hyperparams to control the weight of each of these components.\n",
    "  - Finally, we could use GRPO, to train the model based a collection of it's own outputs, and picking the best output from them. This is the same methodology used to train Deepseek R1.\n",
    "  - DSPy does support optmising a model with GRPO, using the Arbor RL server. I would aim to experiment with this approach.\n",
    "- Finally, our solution still uses a hosted model. \n",
    "  - Some businesses may want to use their own hosted/open-source model, particularly those with goverment regulations.\n",
    "  - We would experiment with the `BootstrapFinetune` method from DSPy to finetune a small LM to match the performance of a large LM. Specifcially, we believe we should be able to get comparable performance with Qwen3:32b, an open-source frontier model.\n",
